# Josh Kincheloe

### Welcome to my portfolio page

Thanks for coming along to check out the source code. That either means you liked what you saw or I did something horribly wrong that you want to see :wink: Either way, let me know! I'm always looking to improve.

### Just a little about the project

As you can probably tell by now, I built this in React. The notable libraries I brought in were <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber/">react-three-fiber</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mattdesl/lerp">lerp</a>.

Seeing as this is a site to showcase some of my capabilities, I will be continuously optimizing and occasionally adding new features. If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to shoot me a message!
